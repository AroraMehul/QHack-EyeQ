# eyeQ - Your Visionary Assistant


eyeQ is an innovative device that aims to empower visually impaired individuals with a comprehensive set of functionalities, enabling them to navigate their surroundings independently and access information effortlessly. Leveraging the power of the Oak-D camera, eyeQ utilizes cutting-edge hardware and software capabilities, including the IMU and depth cameras, to provide an enhanced and inclusive user experience.

## Hardware - Oak-D Camera

The Oak-D camera serves as the core hardware component of eyeQ. This powerful camera module is equipped with an integrated depth camera and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). The depth camera enables accurate depth perception and object detection, while the IMU provides essential data for fall detection and precise positioning. By harnessing these features, eyeQ can create a holistic view of the environment, facilitating seamless navigation and interaction.
